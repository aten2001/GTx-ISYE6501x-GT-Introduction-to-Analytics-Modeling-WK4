Question 1

Using the same crime data set as in Homework 3 Question 4, apply Principal Component Analysis and then create a regression model using the first 4 principal components. Specify your new model in terms of the original variables (not the principal components), and compare its quality to that of your solution to Homework 3 Question 4. You can use the R function prcomp for PCA. (Note that to first scale the data, you can include scale. = TRUE to scale as part of the PCA function.)

Question 2

Using the same crime data set as in Homework 3 Question 4, find the best model you can using (a) a regression tree model, and (b) a random forest model. In R, you can use the tree package or the rpart package, and the randomForest package. For each model, describe one or two qualitative takeaways you get from analyzing the results (i.e., don’t just stop when you have a good model, but interpret it too).

Question 4

1. Using the GermanCredit data set at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learningdatabases/
statlog/german / (description at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29 ), use logistic
regression to find a good predictive model for whether credit applicants are good credit risks or
not. Show your model (factors used and their coefficients), the software output, and the quality
of fit. You can use the glm function in R. To get a logistic regression (logit) model on data where
the response is either zero or one, use family=binomial(link=”logit”) in your glm function call.

2. Because the model gives a result between 0 and 1, it requires setting a threshold probability to
separate between “good” and “bad” answers. In this data set, they estimate that incorrectly
identifying a bad customer as good, is 5 times worse than incorrectly classifying a good
customer as bad. Determine a good threshold probability based on your model.
